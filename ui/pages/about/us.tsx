          On August 2nd, 2014 we were commissioned by <a title="Compass Bible Church Aliso Viejo" href="http://www.compasschurch.org" target="_blank">Compass Bible Church in Aliso Viejo</a>.
          Pastor Bobby, his wife Christa and their three children (Tyler, Emma and Jack) were sent out to plant another Compass here in Huntington Beach.
          Twelve families moved up with them, but there are also Compass family members who already lived here in north Orange County.

            <p>
              Our goal is for the word of the Lord to sound forth here in Huntington Beach so many will put their faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
              This was the theme of our first sermon which you can watch here: <a href="sermons/and-the-gospel-rings-out">#1 – And the Gospel Rings Out</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Compass Bible Church, we believe a good sermon does not come from our own opinions, but is God preaching his message through us.
